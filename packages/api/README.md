# dope-api

The Dope Wars api consists of a golang service that exposes a graphql endpoint. The goal is to provide a unified endpoint for blockchain data (ethereum, optimism, starknet), user data (signed messages + offchain data), and ingame assets (composite hustler illustrations, sprites, ect) that will enable people to easily build on top of the dopewars ecosystem.

## Quick Start

Install golang and run the api from the repo root:

```bash
# Launch an interactive docker runtime instance
bin/shell

# Inside the docker image, launch a local postgres instance
sh -c "bin/pgdev"

# Inside docker image launch API
cd packages/api
go run cmd/main.go
```

The server is exposed on `:8000` and you can visit the playground at `http://localhost:8000/playground`.

## Architecture

Our API service is written in golang which uses [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) to generate a graphql api. The graphql api is bound automatically to the db model which is managed by [ent.go](https://github.com/ent/ent). Smart contract bindings and event handlers are generated from abis using [ethgen](https://github.com/withtally/synceth).

You can learn more about the graphql <> db auto binding [here](https://entgo.io/docs/tutorial-todo-gql).

There are two services in this API, the indexer; and the API HTTP Server. The Dope Wars API auto-scales, and the indexer uses a single instance taking advantage of [App Engine manual scaling](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed).

### Adding a smart contract

To generate new smart contract bindings, add the abi to `packages/api/internal/contracts/abis` and run `go generate ./...`.

### Updating the schema

Modify the schema in `packages/api/internal/ent/schema` and run `go generate ./...`

### Deploying the API

The Dope Wars API runs on Google Cloud Platform using App Engine in the "Standard" environment.

At the time of this writing, [App Engine Standard Environment only supports up to Go 1.16](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments), so that should be the version you develop in.

#### Run these commands to deploy

```bash
cd packages/api
gcloud app deploy --appyaml app.mainnet.api.yaml
gcloud app deploy --appyaml app.mainnet.indexer.yaml
gcloud app deploy --appyaml app.mainnet.game.yaml
```
