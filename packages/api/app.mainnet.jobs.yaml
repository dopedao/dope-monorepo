# App Engine security settings are non-intuitive.
# To prevent the general public from accessing our "job" endpoints
# the most simple way is to specific `login:admin` on each
#
# You'd think that one could simply set the App Engine "ingress"
# to "internal" and it would be smart enough to figure it out; but it's not.
