# Only the "game" server is currently being built via Dockerfile
# to host on GCP "Flexible Environment". 
#
# If we want to host other services on "flexible" env we should
# probably restructure the code in such a fashion that each thing
# lives in its own top-level "packages" directoryâ€¦
# EX: packages/api, packages/game-server, packages/api-indexer

# FOR GAE Flexible Environment Custom Runtime
