LootLoose is an ERC-1155 contract which allows you to:
1. Open your [Loot bags](https://www.lootrng.com/) and mint 8 ERC-1155 tokens, corresponding to each item
in the bag
2. Re-assemble your ERC721 bag by giving back the ERC-1155 tokens to the contract

Each ERC1155's token URI is a b64 encoded SVG image, with the item's name (just that item's, not
any other item from the bag that contained it).

You can mint the 8 ERC-1155 tokens via 2 ways:
1. `approve` the `LootLoose.sol` contract to spend your NFT (or via `setApprovalForAll`) and calling `open`.
2. Transferring your NFT directly to the contract, triggerring the `onERC721Received` callback

You can reassemble the bag by first `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` for the tokens
contained in the bag and then calling `reassemble`.

Average gas cost to `open` is 322k gas, to `reassemble` 165k.

A UI is available for these contracts at [lootloose.com](https://lootloose.com) ([repo](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/lootloose.com))

## Building and testing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gakonst/lootloose
cd lootloose
make
make test
```

## Installing the toolkit

If you do not have DappTools already installed, you'll need to run the below
commands

### Install Nix

```sh
# User must be in sudoers
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Run this or login again to use Nix
. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh"
```

### Install DappTools

```sh
curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh
```

### Security Notes

* In order to improve gas efficiency, OZ's ERC1155.sol was patched to expose the `_balances`
mapping. We use that to do a batch mint inside `open`.
* Dom's original [LootComponents](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1432403895008088064) was modified
to be cheaper to use, since it did a lot of redundant `SLOAD`s in hot code paths.
