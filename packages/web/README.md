## The DOPE DAO DESKTOP

Contains the DOPEWARS.EXE desktop to view your loot, unbundle, generate Hustlers, and buy/sell.

### Features
1. uses `@emotion`: [emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh) for styling.
2. uses `typescript`
3. based on [next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### Getting Started

```bash
yarn
yarn web dev
```

The application accepts the below environment variables, you WILL need to specify the network ID along with either a Curator ID or a Contract Address:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TITLE=[default app title]
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION=[default meta description]
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=[production-url]

If you include a rpcUrl on the manage auction hooks provider it enables walletconnect,
without that rpcUrl walletconnect will not work work. We have set included and .env variable for this: ```NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL```.
