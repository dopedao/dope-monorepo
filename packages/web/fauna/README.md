# Fauna Database Readme

This folder contains files useful for creating and updating fauna schema, stored functions, etc.

[Production and development offchain data is stored here.](https://dashboard.fauna.com/db/us/dope-monorepo)

We're using GraphQL to create schemas and interface with the stored offchain data; which contains cached information about DOPE NFTs, Stockpile Items, and Hustlers.
