                    Welcome OG Hustlers to the beginnings of our Dope City Murderverse! What we have to show is the culmination of untiring efforts from our developers, artists, musicians, and YOU, our community. 
                    It represents the love for what we stand for, the values that we live by, and our unwillingness to waver from them. We are web3. We are hip-hop culture. 
                    We are free minds. We are from all walks of life that have come together for this unified purpose. We are hustlers. What does it represent for you?

                <Text>
                    Thank you so much for your support. 
                    We felt it was completely necessary to invite you all to our first stress test of Dope City, where you can interact with other hustlers by chatting, flexing your gear, and figuring out how to stack PAPER.  
                    It is a glimpse into a world that has become entrenched in a battle for glory, a struggle for reputation, and a fight for leadership. Welcome to Dope Wars. How will the story unfold?

                    Thanks for joining us today everyone, it is with true joy and proudness that we're presenting you the current state of game!

                    However, please note that this is not the final state of the game and that some parts are still unfinished and *buggy*, so please don't expect
                    the best performance and accuracy. After all, this is still just **fun** stress test so don't be afraid to play around with the game and see what you can do (break)!
