## DOPE NFT

![DOPE NFT #0001](/images/dope-nft-1.svg#float-left)

[A limited edition of 8,000 DOPE NFTs were created in September 2021.](https://opensea.io/collection/dope-v4) 

These bundles contain Gear with randomized attributes and rarity scores. Each NFT allows you to build a "Hustler" character to be used in our upcoming games, and provides an equal Governance Vote on Proposals from the DAO.

### DAO Governance + Compensation
To fund the DOPE DAO treasury we've established a 5% royalty payment on each sale, held by the DAO until released by community vote.

Community members draft [proposals](https://dope-wars.notion.site/626df3ff9e4d47da98ea23abc4b6e7a7?v=6350c7a1a9ba4a1c953c8cc4f9a0f062) to use these funds on projects that are then voted on by DOPE NFT holders. This governance structure is how we're able to continue building the DOPE WARS ecosystem with a loose collection of shifting contributors.

## Hustlers

[Learn more about Hustlers on our Wiki.](https://dope-wars.notion.site/dope-wars/Dope-Wiki-e237166bd7e6457babc964d1724befb2#d491a70fab074062b7b3248d6d09c06a)

![Hustlers](/images/hustlers.png#full-bleed)

Hustlers are in-game characters that are created by Claiming Gear from an original DOPE NFT, then minting a Hustler NFT with artwork all stored on the Ethereum blockchain. [This proposal passed our second DAO vote](https://dope-wars.notion.site/Pixel-Avatar-Project-0f64bb450aba46cebdced07c63f69bce).

## $PAPER

[$PAPER is an Ethereum token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dope-wars-paper), and the in-game asset of Dope Wars â€“ our p2e homage of the game we all played on our calculators instead of paying attention in math class.

![PAPER Airdrop](/images/paper-chopper.png#full-bleed)

$PAPER was originally distributed through a claimable amount of 125,000 per $DOPE NFT. Each NFT allows a claim of 125,000 $PAPER once and only once â€“ and regardless of the current holder the NFT does not allow for more than one claim. These claims are the only source of $PAPERâ€™s supply currently. 

To see if your DOPE NFT is eligible please connect your wallet in DOPEWARS.EXE and view it. If you need to obtain $PAPER, please do so from a site like [Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0xad6d2f2cb7bf2c55c7493fd650d3a66a4c72c483).

## What is the supply of $PAPER?

The supply of paper is currently fixed at 1 billion, and while this can be increased with a DAO governance vote â€“ the current consensus is that this wonâ€™t be necessary. When details of the economy in-game and in the broader ecosystem get closer to the end of the design stage the DAO may remove the ability to increase the supply of $PAPER from the contract entirely.
