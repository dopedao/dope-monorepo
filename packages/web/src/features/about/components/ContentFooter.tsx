### How does the DAO work?
To fund the DOPE DAO treasury we've established a 5% royalty payment on each sale, held by the DAO until released by community vote.

Community members draft [proposals](https://dope-wars.notion.site/626df3ff9e4d47da98ea23abc4b6e7a7?v=6350c7a1a9ba4a1c953c8cc4f9a0f062) to use these funds on projects that are then voted on by DOPE NFT holders. This governance structure is how we're able to continue building the DOPE WARS ecosystem with a loose collection of shifting contributors.

### What is the supply of $PAPER?

The supply of paper is currently fixed at 1.5 billion. In June 2022 [the DAO voted to increase the supply by 500M](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/proposal/30600128298117676277554169874283776405585867552052066919092841814555374554857), which is held in our treasury. This PAPER is being held to incentivize future contributors, and potentially to fund future development in private token sales. When details of the economy in-game and in the broader ecosystem get closer to the end of the design stage the DAO may remove the ability to increase the supply of $PAPER from the contract entirely.
