### How does the DAO work?
To fund the DOPE DAO treasury we've established a 5% royalty payment on each sale, held by the DAO until released by community vote.

Community members draft [proposals](https://dope-wars.notion.site/626df3ff9e4d47da98ea23abc4b6e7a7?v=6350c7a1a9ba4a1c953c8cc4f9a0f062) to use these funds on projects that are then voted on by DOPE NFT holders. This governance structure is how we're able to continue building the DOPE WARS ecosystem with a loose collection of shifting contributors.

### What is the supply of $PAPER?

The supply of paper is currently fixed at 1 billion, and while this can be increased with a DAO governance vote â€“ the current consensus is that this wonâ€™t be necessary. When details of the economy in-game and in the broader ecosystem get closer to the end of the design stage the DAO may remove the ability to increase the supply of $PAPER from the contract entirely.
