# What is this?

_Dope Wars is an ongoing NFT art project and experiment in DAO Governance._

The Dope DAO is [producing one of the first play-to-earn crypto games](https://dope-wars.notion.site/DIP-4-RYO-v1-c65d88de9abe49c08afa60d69a6cb1bc) on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by the classic TI-83 game we played instead of doing math homework.

## DOPE NFT

![DOPE LOOT NFT #0001](/images/dope-nft-1.svg#float-left)

[A limited edition of 8,000 DOPE NFTs were created in September 2021.](https://opensea.io/collection/dope-v4) 

These bundles contain items with randomized attributes and rarity scores. Each one allows you to build a character to be used in game and provides an equal Governance Vote on Proposals from the DAO.


### DAO Governance + Compensation
To fund the DOPE DAO treasury we've established a 5% royalty payment that is held by the DAO until released by community vote.

Community members draft [proposals](https://dope-wars.notion.site/626df3ff9e4d47da98ea23abc4b6e7a7?v=6350c7a1a9ba4a1c953c8cc4f9a0f062) to use these funds on projects that are then voted on by DOPE NFT holders. This governance structure is how we're able to continue building the DOPE WARS ecosystem with a loose collection of shifting contributors.

## Characters

![Hustlers and Dealers](/images/hustlers.png#full-bleed)

Hustlers and Dealers are created by unbundling your DOPE NFT, equipping them with items, then minting a Hustler NFT with artwork all stored on the Ethereum blockchain. [This proposal passed our second DAO vote](https://dope-wars.notion.site/Pixel-Avatar-Project-0f64bb450aba46cebdced07c63f69bce), and we hope to launch sometime in October 2021.

## $PAPER

[$PAPER is an Ethereum token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dope-wars-paper), and the in-game asset of Dope Wars – our p2e homage of the game we all played on our calculators instead of paying attention in math class.

You can obtain $PAPER by claiming it from an original DOPE NFT, or by swapping for it on a distributed exchange like [Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0x811f8c60ee1805db7ece0fa3c7b064feba887053).

![PAPER Airdrop](/images/paper-chopper.png#full-bleed)
You are automatically entitled to claim 125,000 $PAPER for each Dope Wars Loot NFT using this [contract address on EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ae1d57b58fa6411f32948314badd83583ee0e8c).

_Each DOPE NFT is able to claim $PAPER only once._

To see if your Dope Wars Loot NFT is eligible please connect your wallet in DOPEWARS.EXE and view your Loot.

## DOPEWARS.EXE

Our first project is to provide a portal for the DOPE WARS ecosystem. Additional experiences like the game will be hosted here.

#### Now
You can connect an Ethereum Wallet to see all of the DOPE NFT’s that you have purchased.

#### Soon
Very shortly, you’ll be able to [unbundle your items, create a PFP of your Dope Dealer](https://dope-wars.notion.site/Dope-Wars-Ignition-e92fd2b6efeb4e4991c7df98f5553283), and trade individual items with other players to equip your Dope Dealer in our MARKET.
