# What is this?

_Dope Wars is an NFT project and an experiment in DAO Governance._

The Dope DAO is producing one of the first play-to-earn crypto games on the Ethereum blockchain, inspired by the classic TI-83 game we played instead of doing math homework.

## DOPE NFT

![DOPE LOOT NFT #0001](/images/dope-nft-1.svg#float-left)

DOPE NFTs are bundles of Items, with randomized rarity scores.

Each DOPE NFT allows you to build a character around a collection of Items to be used in game. Each DOPE NFT also provides an equal Governance Vote on Proposals from the DAO.


## $PAPER

![PAPER Airdrop](/images/paper-chopper.png#full-bleed)
You are automatically entitled to claim 125,000 $PAPER for each Dope Wars Loot NFT using [contract address on EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ae1d57b58fa6411f32948314badd83583ee0e8c). 

_Each DOPE NFT is able to claim only once._

To see if your Dope Wars Loot NFT is eligible please [use the claim check tool available here](https://dwlclaimcheck.surge.sh/).

**What is the point of $PAPER?**

$PAPER is the in-game asset of Dope Wars, our p2e homage of the game we all played on our TI-85 calculators instead of paying attention in math class. Because we don't know how much $PAPER will be needed in the game economy, there is no fixed supply of $PAPER.  

After all, Dope Wars takes place in a world post-1971, so a fixed monetary supply wouldn't really be accurate nor work for the fast-paced, high-action world of DOPE.  Dope DAO will be our Federal Reserve.

----

### Currently… 
You can connect an Ethereum Wallet to see all of the DOPE NFT’s that you have purchased.

----

### Soon…
You’ll be able to [unbundle your items, create a PFP of your Dope Dealer](https://dope-wars.notion.site/Dope-Wars-Ignition-e92fd2b6efeb4e4991c7df98f5553283), and trade individual items with other players to equip your Dope Dealer.

----

### The DOPE DAO is supported by gamers like you
5% of each purchase of a DOPE NFT is deposited into our treasury. This allows us to continue improving the DOPE WARS ecosystem.
